# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
I have created a workday scheduler that adds events when clicked on the time card header.  When the save button is pressed the event is saved into local storage and loaded upon return to the site.

Here is the Create Event function code

As you can se here the times are color coded based on past, present or future status.  Currently it is before 8am
